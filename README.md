# PWA with Rocket Rust

I made this progressive web app for the minor Web Design & Development for Progressive Web App.
The server side code is written in Rust, using the Rocket framework.
It renders the HTML with Handlebars on the server before sending it to the client.
Most of the functionality of the site is still available without JS this way, unlike the version I wrote with Svelte originally.

The HTML and CSS are based on the code I wrote for CSS to the rescue.

## Week 1 - Monday and Tuesday

I wrote the code for the webserver and made the comment section server side rendered on the first two days.
This was a little difficult, but not too bad.
It was a bit difficult to get a grip on the Rocket framework and on Rust itself, but it was doable.
It's a good thing I am not a bad server-side programmer, if I say so myself.
