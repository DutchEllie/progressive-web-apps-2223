          Hi again, thanks for visiting another one of my pages! This one has
          all sorts of links to other people their websites. Some of these
          people are my friends, other websites I have no idea who maintains
          them. In both cases, I think they are worth sharing, so here we are!

            A website made by Sebastiaan. A massive Linux fanboy, runs Gentoo on
            his ThinkPad. Absolutely based. His website is written in Lisp,
            that's why it's often offline. That was the inspiration for the
            online/offline status text.

          These websites are not necessarily made by people I know. They are
          just random websites I have found on the internet or websites from
          organisations I support.

            A VERY cool website made by Ylimegirl! They wrote a whole website
            dedicated to Evillious Chronicles, which is a super good Japanese
            light novel and vocaloid series!! Definitely look it up!

            The official website of the GNU project. They advocate for
            free/libre software. This is not to be confused with 'open source'
            software. I highly recommend you read about them and their efforts.
